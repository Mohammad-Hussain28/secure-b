						<span><centre><h2>TYPES OF HOME LOANS WE PROVIDE</h2></centre></span>
						<p>This is the most common type of home loan availed to purchase a house. There are many housing finance companies, public banks, and private banks that offer housing loans where you borrow money to purchase the house of your choice and repay the loan in monthly instalments.<br>
							You can get up to 80%-90% of the houseâ€™s market price in the form of financing. The lender will hold the house until you completely repay the loan.</p> -->

						<h3>Types Of Home Loans</h3>
						<p> Fixed Rate Mortgage (FRM) : <br><br>
							Features a constant interest rate throughout the loan term. Predictable monthly payments, providing stability and budgeting ease.</p>
							<p>Adjustable-Rate Mortgage (ARM):<br><br>
								Interest rates may fluctuate based on market conditions. Initial lower rates but subject to change, often after an initial fixed period.
							</p>
							<p>Federal Housing Administration(FHA):<br><br>
								Government-backed loans with lower down payment requirements. Suitable for first-time homebuyers or those with limited finances.
							</p>
								<h3>Benifits Of Home Loan</h3>
							<p>Tax Benifits : <br><br>Certain home loan components, such as principal and interest repayments, may be eligible for tax deductions.</p>
							<p>Insurance Options : <br><br> Lenders often provide insurance options like home loan insurance to protect against unforeseen circumstances.</p>
							<p>EMI Options :<br><br>Equated Monthly Installments (EMIs) can be customized based on income and financial situations.</p>
							<p>Part-payment Facility :<br><br> Some loans permit partial repayment of the principal amount, reducing the overall interest burden.</p>
							<h3>Caution</h3>
							<p align="justify">It's crucial to carefully review and compare these features from various lenders to choose a home loan that aligns with your financial goals and preferences.</p>
							</div>
							<!-- <div class="row-6 row-12-mobilep">
								<h3>Lower Interest Rate</h3>
								<p>The home loan interest rate is much lower as compared to any other loan types available. If you come across a cash crunch, you may get a top-up on the existing home loan at a lower interest rate than a personal loan to solve the issue.</p>
